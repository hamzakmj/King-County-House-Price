# King-County-House-Price
##price-prediction:)

so this project is aimed towards predicting house prices in 2016/2017/2018
the data I have is for  kings county in Washington State (u.s.a)
and just for the year 2014/2015 small data I know lol
so the project is separated for two weeks.
#week (1)
which represent the first there points in making a model roadmap.
###1-Problem Definition
 -What we can tell about prices in (2014-2015)? 
-What are the important findings we can glean? 
-What are the summary statistics of this data? 
###2-data wrangling
witch, we aimed towards having good data (clean  and try to fix any issue init)
###3-Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
here we try to explore the data and learn from it to find some insight and which features affect the price of the houses and which feature is highly correlated with other features(explore the data in plots like heat map scatter etc.)
#week(2)
model building and representing 
###4-Pre_processing and Training data development
 so in this stage, we take the fixed data and chose the features which will be sent to model 
###5-Modeling
so we tried a lot of models the last one is the best because it uses the gradient-boosting method

###6-Documentation of the model
you can find it here 
The last important thing in the model deploy I used python to build a simple GUI for a user to predict house price (i mean it takes 3 days first GUI I think is good but not perfect in the future i will finish it in sha Allah
